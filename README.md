## my_shell

"my_shell" is a basic UNIX shell based on the school42's project 42sh.
You can see the [subject](https://github.com/adandres/my_shell/blob/master/42sh.en.pdf) here.

## Installation

First you need to clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adandres/my_shell.git
```
Once cloned and moved into the directory, type "make" to compile the program.
```bash
 make
```
"my_shell" builds with gcc.
## Usage

To launch the program type:
```bash
./my_shell
```
Once launched, you can use it like a normal shell.

## Disclaimer
I haven't finished it but it should be stable, still, there might be some leaks and crashs, feel free to report any issue.
